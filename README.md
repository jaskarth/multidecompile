# Jasmine's Quiltflower Tools

In my time leading Quiltflower development, I've wished that certain tools existed to make my development easier. This is a collection of those tools.
Here you will find:
- Multi-Decompile: Allows you to decompile the same jar/classfile across multiple versions of Quiltflower, and compare those outputs.
- Regression Suite: A tool to automatically run Quiltflower against a huge (~200MB) set of libraries and diff the output.
