# Quiltflower Multi-Decompile
This is a project I threw together in about 5 minutes because I wanted to diff Quiltflower versions across multiple versions.
To use, drop your class file or jar file into ./input/ and your Quiltflower jars into ./input/ . Your decompiled file will be in ./output/<qfver>/.
This should also work with other Fernflower derivatives.
